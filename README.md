# News-app

This news app scrapes the Washington Post newspaper website and saves articles in a database. The app allows articles to be saved and deleted. It also allows users to make comments and delete them. 

Technologies used in the app include: Node, Handlebars, m\Mongodb, Cheerios, Axios, and Express

My role was writing the code for the app. Links to screen shots showing the app is working are below.
